        "The reliability and usefulness of Zambian Wikipedia pages as a source of current information can be affected when the content becomes outdated  \n",
        "In many cases information that once was accurate is left unchanged for long periods of time and this makes it hard for readers to trust that what they are reading reflects the present situation  \n",
        "\n",
        "Without a clear and organized way to identify which pages are stale or contain old data it is difficult for contributors especially Zambian Wikipedians to know where their attention is most needed  \n",
        "This lack of direction means that updates can be random or uneven and some topics remain untouched while others are repeatedly edited  \n",
        "\n",

This turns the challenge of stale information into a clear, structured task.\n",

Instead of random edits, contributors can follow a clear queue that shows where updates will have the most impact.

        "- **Interpretability and Actionability**  \n",
        "  The predictions of the model and the factors influencing them must be understandable to human editors. Contributors should be able to see why a page is flagged as outdated and also get clear guidance on what needs updating. The results should be actionable so Wikipedians can focus their efforts where they matter most  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scalability**  \n",
        "  The model should be capable of being applied to a wide range of Zambian Wikipedia pages and not just a single Zambia page. Broader application will make the tool useful for long term and large scale improvements  \n",

        "- **Feedback Integration**  \n",
