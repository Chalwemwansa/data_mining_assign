        "The reliability and usefulness of Zambian Wikipedia pages as a source of current information can be affected when the content becomes outdated  \n",

        "\n",
        "Without a clear and organized way to identify which pages are stale or contain old data it is difficult for contributors especially Zambian Wikipedians to know where their attention is most needed  \n",
        "This lack of direction means that updates can be random or uneven and some topics remain untouched while others are repeatedly edited  \n",
        "\n",
        "Over time this results in a reduced quality of content on and about Zambia making the platform less valuable as a resource for people who rely on it for research learning or keeping up with developments in the country."
